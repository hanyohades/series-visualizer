**Course:** Math 1C — Calculus III  

This project provides a visual tool for exploring the behavior of common infinite series. Built with `tkinter` and `matplotlib`, the app computes and plots both the individual terms \( a_n \) and the partial sums \( S_n \), helping users to analyze convergence and divergence.

## 📦 Features

- Visualize terms \( a_n \) and partial sums \( S_n \)
- Supports 7 series types:
  - Geometric series
  - Harmonic series
  - Alternating Harmonic series
  - p-series
  - Alternating p-series
  - Sum of 1
  - Exponential decay
- Displays LaTeX-style formulas and verdicts on convergence
- Input validation and helpful error messages

## ⚙️ Requirements

Only required if running from source (not the .exe):

- Python 3.7+
- `tkinter`
- `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:
